# Sentiment Analysis with scikit-learn

In this notebook I built a logistic regression model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. I used the popular IMDB data set. The goal is to use a simple logistic regression estimator from scikit-learn for document classification.

Key steps:
- Clean and pre-process text data.
- Perform feature extraction with The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).
- Build and employ a logistic regression classifier using scikit-learn.
- Tune model hyperparameters and evaluate model accuracy.
